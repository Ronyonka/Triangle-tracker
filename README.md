# Triangle Tracker
#### Triangle Tracker, December 3 2018
#### By **Ron Onyonka**
## Description
The triangle tracker is a program that is able to take three different estimated values/measurements of a side of a triangle and tell if those measurements will form a triangle or not. If it does form a triangle it can also
tell you what type of triangle it forms.
Try it out.https://ronyonka.github.io/Triangle-tracker/

## BDD
This site compares three values input by the user
* First it checks if the values can form a triangle. If the sum of two sides of the triangle are greater than the third side. If two the sum of two sides of the  triangle are less than or equal to the third side the three measurments will not be able to form a triangle, if so it will alert the user that it will not be able to form a triangle.
* If the values input by the user are all equal, it will alert the user that the triangle is equilateral.
* If two sides/values input are equal, it will alert the user that the triangle is isosceles.
* If no sides are equal to each other, it will then alert user that the triangle is scalene.
