## Description
The triangle tracker is a program that is able to take three different estimated values/measurements of a side of a triangle and tell if those measurements will form a triangle or not. If it does form a triangle it can also
tell you what type of triangle it forms.

## BDD
I began the project by recognizing that I needed to make an app that would take user input of
three different values and display a result. The first step was to create a form with input tags
to take the User input. For this I needed Three input elements and a button to submit to call a JavaScript function. I then used JS to check if the values formed a triangle or not, and if they did, what sort of triangle finally I added a query to display the result on HTML. I then added styling.
